Roadmap for Tali Forth for the 65c02 
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
This version: 01. March 2017

=== MAJOR REWRITE === 

Tali Forth is currently undergoing a major rewrite. The aim is to incorporate what 
was learned since the first major version and to synchronize the development with 
Liara Forth (https://github.com/scotws/LiaraForth). 


MAJOR POINTS

- Split the Dictionary headers from the code
- Convert everything to lower-case


DETAILS

- Check if DOVAR needlessly uses temporary storage
- Check if f_postpo_int is ever used at all
- Code D>S so it respects the sign
- Remove TOUPPER
- >NAME becomes INT>NAME as in Liara Forth
